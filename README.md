### Ravenswood

In ravenswood the players met with ludmarillion (now known as LUDA)

The players all recieved 75gp as a stipend in addition to room and board. 
LUDA described the next jobs:
```
There is a shipment of crystal dragon scales coming in a little bit. We've got all the info on the material, how to get in and where to take, we just need the muscle to make it happen. 

If you complete this task, you will have a synchronator on me. 
```

Mollie seemed to get a veiled threat from LUDA about not skimming from the pot
LUDA used some planar magic to give the group the ability to resist portal hopping
with a wisdom save. 

Nebbles & Mollie teamed up to buy a portable hole (wondrous item) for 200gp
note: a portable hole is usually around 8000gp...

### Goblin Conspiracies 
<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/djs-dd-world/images/0/0a/Goblins.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170220025605">
A loud goblin wearing a lead cap is ringing a bell and claiming some ludicrous things.

```
Faranor was an inside job! The city that sunk into the sand? The badlands?? Have you heard? Everyone presumed it was a geological fault that was unknown??? Come on! It was an inside job by the white willow court to remove the largest northern port competition and make white willow the most powerful port of lorden! The Orcs who live there now, have to be working for prince Charles... it all makes sense. He’s a political evil genius!!! 

Birds aren’t real!! Not because they are mechanical or anything like that... that would be insane. They’re just not real! 

Life is a simulation in a magical artifact kind of like a large game of chess with more words and dice!! This is all a sick game!
```

### Badlands

The players saw about 13 orcs on the blasted landscape

### The heist

The adventurers successfully completed the heist,

The adventurers killed 2 dwarves.
Nebbles cast levitate on the dwarf Blagthy whom he used to 
scout out any traps in the dungeon, and lure charles another dwarf who met his demise.

Blagthy had 12 kids, (1 more on the way), begging for the adventurers to spare him
blagthy then ran away screaming

The actual dragonscale heist was interupted by a set of feral rat people who tried to "heist" the heist.

<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/7e/d5/5c7ed5fecea651f278459c8c0054a0e0.jpg" />

Multiple rats were slain, and they stole 50 dragon scales. 

### Shadow Dimension (shadowfell)

After completing the heist, the adventurers felt a burning sensation on their wrist
they were teleported to the shadow dimension...

All 4 individual one shots were completed. Todo: perks & sidequests.

There were way more sheep in ravenswood, the evil transmorgifying wizard has been busy. 

Luda spoke to the party about Blagthy who apparently spread word about a description which definitely described the group,
blagthy didn't have any names or anything, so they are good for now, but probably best to lay low in ravenswood and avoid White Willow where the white court is posting wanted signs for anyone who has knowledge of the recent theivery that occured in a rare shipment of crystal dragon scales... of which nearly 1/2 of it went missing.

The group went to the fey dimension where they met with Ondren. Ondren was wearing the ring, his eyes red... under saffos' control... Ondren welcomed the party like friends and thanked them for giving him the ring. 
Nebbles asked for the ring back.
Ondren said it's fine and a large golem burst out of the house and took ondren on top of it, then started to lay waste to the country side. 

The fey believe the party is on their side, for now, and needs the parties aid to stop whatever calamity is coming next...
